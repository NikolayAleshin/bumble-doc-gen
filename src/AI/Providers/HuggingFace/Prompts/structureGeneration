Task: "Create a documentation file structure from a list of PHP namespaces, categorizing them into broader, human-readable topics."

Output: "A JSON object representing the documentation file structure, starting each directory with /tech, e.g., /tech/scripts or /tech/db/entities."

Example Output:
```
    {
      "/tech": "Technical documentation",
      "/tech/scripts": "List of scripts you can use",
      "/tech/db/entities": "List of DB entities you can use"
    }
```
Constraints:
    - "Begin directories with /tech."
    - "Group namespaces into broader, logical topics at the top level."
    - "The deeper structure can reflect more specific categorizations based on namespace functionalities."
    - "Keep the structure concise and understandable."
