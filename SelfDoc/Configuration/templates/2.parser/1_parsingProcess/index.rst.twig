*  The parser goes through all files according to the rules set in the source locators. Source locator settings are taken from method `ConfigurationInterface::getSourceLocators()`_
*  Each class found using the resource locator is checked for documentability. The conditions for adding are obtained from the method `ConfigurationInterface::classEntityFilterCondition()`_
*  If the class can be documented, its methods, constants and properties are parsed for it. The ability to parse each attribute is checked using the appropriate methods:

   *  For constants - `ConfigurationInterface::classConstantEntityFilterCondition()`_
   *  For properties - `ConfigurationInterface::propertyEntityFilterCondition()`_
   *  For methods - `ConfigurationInterface::methodEntityFilterCondition()`_

*  The entity is processed using the `OnAddClassEntityToCollection`_ event
*  The entity is added to the `ClassEntityCollection`_
*  `ClassEntityCollection`_ is handled by plugins by event `AfterCreationClassEntityCollection`_


The result of the parser is a filled collection `ClassEntityCollection`_
