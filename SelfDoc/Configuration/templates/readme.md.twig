{{ "Bumble Documentation Generator" | textToHeading('H1') }}

This library was created in order to simplify the process of generating technical documentation for complex projects and simple projects.
The main idea of the project is to allow library users to create handwritten documentation with dynamic blocks, the information for which is parsed from the code according to the rules specified in the configuration.

The system is flexible and easily expandable, as you can see when you start working with it. Write your first documentation today! :)
