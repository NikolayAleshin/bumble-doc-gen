{{ "How to use the library" | textToHeading('H1') }}

This documentation generator is a library that allows you to create handwritten documentation with dynamic blocks that are loaded from the project code or other places.

Flow of work with the documentation generation library:

```mermaid
 graph TD;
    A(1. User wants to document the project)
    B(2. Creates and fills documentation configuration file)
    C(3. Creates templates for future documentation)
    D(4. Generates documentation based on templates)

    A --> B
    B --> C
    C --> D

    note1[Note: Documentation is placed next to the code according to settings]
    D --> note1
```

To start the documentation generation process, you need to call the following command:

{{ "(new DocGeneratorFactory())->create($configFile)->generate()" | textToCodeBlock('php') }}

After that, the process of parsing the project code according to the configuration will start, and then filling the templates with data and saving the finished result as final documents.
